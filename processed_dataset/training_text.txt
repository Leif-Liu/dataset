摘要: What is the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics


Based **strictly** on the provided Reference Content (PAGIC-11827-2.md, Chunk ID: 8e88971c05931c4c), the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics is:

1.  **To Ensure Correct Interpretation of Diagnostic Data:** Consistent ASAM ODX file version information is crucial for the `Read Data by Identifier` service to function accurately. The diagnostic tools rely on the structure and definitions within the specific version of the ODX file to correctly interpret the data received from the vehicle's Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in response to requests for specific Data Identifiers (DIDs).

2.  **To Provide Accurate Version Information:** The content explicitly states that maintaining consistent version information is necessary to "provide accurate version information" when queried via diagnostic services. This ensures that the diagnostic tool and the technician have reliable information about the configuration database version in use.

3.  **To Support Reliable Diagnostic Communication:** The ASAM ODX file acts as the `diagnostic configuration database`. Consistency between the version used by the diagnostic tool and the version understood by the vehicle's diagnostic system (e.g., the IVI system implementing UDS according to ISO 14229:2020) is fundamental for reliable communication using UDS diagnostic messages over network protocols like SOME/IP. Mismatched versions could lead to misinterpretation of DIDs, sessions, or other diagnostic parameters.

**Direct Evidence from the Content:**
*   The keywords list includes: "consistent version information" and "Read Data by Identifier".
*   The content discusses the use of the ODX file within a UDS diagnostic context (IVI system, ISO 14229:2020) and the execution of diagnostic services like `Read Data by Identifier` which depend on the database definitions.
*   The ODX file is explicitly referred to as the "diagnostic configuration database".
*   The context involves manual test execution using predefined diagnostic session commands and reading DIDs, which fundamentally relies on the tool and vehicle agreeing on the database definitions provided by the ODX file version.

   > *"The system shall enable the instrument cluster HMI when power is applied (KL15=1) and disable it when power is removed (KL15=0)."*  
3. **Relevance to Question**:  
   - The requirement explicitly defines the instrument cluster HMI's power state behavior (enable/disable) tied to power application/removal (KL15 signal).  
   - No other requirement IDs (e.g., REQ-ID-005/007) or sections (e.g., Test Conditions, Compliance) mention instrument cluster HMI power behavior.  

### Key Observations:  
- The requirement uses unambiguous conditional logic (`KL15=1` for enablement, `KL15=0` for disablement).  
- This is the **only requirement ID** in the document addressing instrument cluster HMI power states.  
- Sections 4 and 5 describe test environments/compliance standards but do not reference requirement IDs or HMI power behavior.  

**Conclusion**:  
The requirement **REQ-ID-006** exclusively governs the instrument cluster HMI power state behavior, as documented in Section 2.6. No other requirement IDs or sections are relevant to this query.

摘要: Where are the primary and secondary speed values displayed on the HMI


Based strictly on the provided document content, the location of the primary and secondary speed values on the HMI is specified as follows:

**Answer:**  
The primary (km/h) and secondary (mph) speed values are displayed **simultaneously in designated areas of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**.  

**Supporting Evidence (from Document):**  
- **Requirement ID: REQ-ID-005** states:  
  *"The system must display both the primary (km/h) and secondary (mph) speed values simultaneously in **designated areas of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**."*  

**Key Observations:**  
1. The document does **not** specify exact coordinates, zones, or visual positions (e.g., "top-left/bottom-right") within the HMI.  
2. The term "designated areas" implies predefined regions configured in the Instrument Cluster software, but these locations are not detailed in this document.  
3. All other requirements (e.g., activation, configuration, data input) reference functionality but do not expand on physical/spatial placement.  

**Conclusion:**  
Per the document, the only explicit information about display location is that both speed values occupy *"designated areas"* within the HMI simultaneously. No further granularity is provided in this content.

摘要: What is the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics


Based strictly on the provided content in **PAGIC-11827-2.md**, the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics is:  

**To ensure the accurate interpretation and execution of diagnostic commands** when interacting with the vehicle's systems. This is specifically demonstrated through:  

1. **Correct DID Interpretation**  
   Consistency guarantees that the **Read Data by Identifier (DID)** service correctly maps and decodes data identifiers (eIDs) between the diagnostic tester and the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system, preventing misinterpretation of vehicle data.  

2. **Session Compatibility**  
   It enables seamless transitions between diagnostic sessions (e.g., **OBDII default session** to **extended session**) by aligning protocol definitions (ISO 14229:2020) and service availability in the **diagnostic configuration database**.  

3. **Test Validation Reliability**  
   In the **RBS Sparks Simulation environment**, consistency ensures predefined diagnostic commands (sent via **UDS messages** over **SOME/IP**) yield expected responses during **manual test execution**, eliminating version-driven discrepancies.  

4. **Protocol Compliance**  
   Matching ODX versions maintain adherence to **Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS)** standards, ensuring network communication protocols and diagnostic service logic behave as configured.  

**Failure to maintain consistency** risks erroneous test results, misdiagnosis of vehicle states, or communication failures due to mismatched service definitions or data formats.  

---
**Supporting Evidence from Content**:  
- Directly referenced **ASAM ODX file version consistency** in the context of **Read Data by Identifier**.  
- Highlighted dependency on the **diagnostic configuration database** for UDS message structure.  
- Emphasized validation in simulation environments where version mismatch disrupts **predefined diagnostic session commands**.  
- Specified reliance on **ISO 14229:2020** and **SOME/IP protocols**, which require aligned ODX data.

摘要: What is the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics


Based strictly on the provided reference content in **PAGIC-11827-2.md**, the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics is:

1.  **To Ensure Consistent DID Definition Interpretation:** The ASAM ODX file serves as the **diagnostic configuration database**. Maintaining a consistent version ensures that the definitions for **Data Identifiers (DIDs)** remain uniform.
2.  **To Avoid Undefined DIDs and Test Failures:** Using an ODX file with a *different version* than expected during **manual test execution** can lead to inconsistencies. Specifically:
    *   The test procedure might request a DID defined in *one version* of the ODX file.
    *   If the vehicle's ECU or the **RBS Sparks Simulation environment** uses a *different ODX version* where that DID is undefined or defined differently, the ECU may return an error (e.g., "sub-function not supported").
    *   This discrepancy causes the test (e.g., a **Read Data by Identifier** request within the **OBDII default diagnostic session** or **extended diagnostic session**) to fail, even if the underlying ECU functionality is correct.
3.  **To Guarantee Test Validity:** Consistent ODX versions are critical for validating the correct implementation and response of **UDS diagnostic messages** (as per **ISO 14229:2020**) over **SOME/IP network communication protocols** in the test environment. Inconsistent versions invalidate the test results by introducing definition mismatches.

**In essence:** Maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information is necessary to ensure that the diagnostic tests (using **predefined diagnostic session commands** and **Read Data by Identifier** for specific DIDs) interact with the vehicle or simulation based on the *same definitions* of parameters and services, preventing false negatives caused by version mismatches in the **diagnostic configuration database**.

摘要: What method is used to configure the secondary speed unit (mph)


Based strictly on the provided content, the method used to configure the secondary speed unit (mph) is:  

**Answer**:  
The secondary speed unit (mph) is configured **via a service message**, as explicitly stated in requirement REQ-ID-003.  

**Supporting Evidence from Reference Content**:  
- Section **2.3 Secondary Unit Configuration** (REQ-ID-003) declares:

摘要: What is the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics


Based strictly on the provided content in **PAGIC-11827-2.md (Chunk ID: 8e88971c05931c4c)**, the purpose of maintaining consistent **ASAM ODX file version information** during diagnostics is:

1.  **To ensure accurate diagnostic communication:** Consistent version information is critical for the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system to correctly interpret and execute Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) commands. This includes fundamental operations like initiating an **OBDII default diagnostic session**, transitioning to an **extended diagnostic session**, and successfully executing **Read Data by Identifier** requests for specific **data identifiers (DIDs)**. Version consistency ensures the diagnostic client and server share the same understanding of session types, DIDs, and their formats.

2.  **To preserve diagnostic configuration integrity:** Maintaining version consistency between the **diagnostic configuration database** (the ASAM ODX file) and the system under test (e.g., within the **RBS Sparks Simulation environment**) is essential. This consistency ensures that **UDS diagnostic messages** sent over **SOME/IP network communication protocols** adhere to the expected structure and semantics defined in the specific version of the ODX file, preventing misinterpretation or failure during **manual test execution** using **predefined diagnostic session commands**.

**In essence:** Consistent ASAM ODX version information guarantees that the diagnostic definitions used to configure tests and send commands (**ISO 14229:2020** UDS) align perfectly with the expected format and behavior of the target system, enabling reliable and accurate diagnostic communication and testing.
