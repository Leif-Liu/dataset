This includes fundamental operations like initiating an **OBDII default diagnostic session**, transitioning to an **extended diagnostic session**, and successfully executing **Read Data by Identifier** requests for specific **data identifiers (DIDs)**. Version consistency ensures the diagnostic client and server share the same understanding of session types, DIDs, and their formats.\n\n2.  **To preserve diagnostic configuration integrity:** Maintaining version consistency between the **diagnostic configuration database** (the ASAM ODX file) and the system under test (e.g., within the **RBS Sparks Simulation environment**) is essential. This consistency ensures that **UDS diagnostic messages** sent over **SOME/IP network communication protocols** adhere to the expected structure and semantics defined in the specific version of the ODX file, preventing misinterpretation or failure during **manual test execution** using **predefined diagnostic session commands**.\n\n**In essence:** Consistent ASAM ODX version information guarantees that the diagnostic definitions used to configure tests and send commands (**ISO 14229:2020** UDS) align perfectly with the expected format and behavior of the target system, enabling reliable and accurate diagnostic communication and testing.",
