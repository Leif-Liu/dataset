摘要: What method is used to configure the secondary speed unit (mph)


Based strictly on the provided content, the method used to configure the secondary speed unit (mph) is:  

**Answer**:  
The secondary speed unit (mph) is configured **via a service message**, as explicitly stated in requirement REQ-ID-003.  

**Supporting Evidence from Reference Content**:  
- Section **2.3 Secondary Unit Configuration** (REQ-ID-003) declares:  
  > *"The system shall support configuration of the secondary speed unit (mph) **via a service message**."*  

**Key Observations**:  
1. **Specificity**: The requirement directly links mph configuration to "service message" as the method.  
2. **Contrast with Other Methods**:  
   - Dual speedometer *activation* uses a "UDS diagnostic message" (REQ-ID-001).  
   - Speed data *input* uses "ETH/SOME/IP message" (REQ-ID-004).  
   This confirms "service message" is the distinct mechanism for secondary unit configuration.  
3. **No Ambiguity**: The content does not reference protocols (e.g., UDS/SOME/IP) or other methods for this specific task.  

**Compliance with Constraints**:  
- ✅ **Source-Based**: Extracted verbatim from REQ-ID-003.  
- ✅ **Accurate & Non-Fabricated**: No external assumptions; uses only documented terminology.  
- ✅ **Relevance**: Addresses the question’s focus on configuration methodology for the secondary unit.  
- ✅ **Detail Sufficiency**: Includes requirement ID, functional section, and explicit quote for fine-tuning usability.

摘要: What is the purpose of maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information during diagnostics


Based strictly on the provided content in **PAGIC-11827-2.md (Chunk ID: 8e88971c05931c4c)**, the purpose of maintaining consistent **ASAM ODX file version information** during diagnostics is:

1.  **To ensure accurate diagnostic communication:** Consistent version information is critical for the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system to correctly interpret and execute Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) commands. This includes fundamental operations like initiating an **OBDII default diagnostic session**, transitioning to an **extended diagnostic session**, and successfully executing **Read Data by Identifier** requests for specific **data identifiers (DIDs)**. Version consistency ensures the diagnostic client and server share the same understanding of session types, DIDs, and their formats.

2.  **To preserve diagnostic configuration integrity:** Maintaining version consistency between the **diagnostic configuration database** (the ASAM ODX file) and the system under test (e.g., within the **RBS Sparks Simulation environment**) is essential. This consistency ensures that **UDS diagnostic messages** sent over **SOME/IP network communication protocols** adhere to the expected structure and semantics defined in the specific version of the ODX file, preventing misinterpretation or failure during **manual test execution** using **predefined diagnostic session commands**.

**In essence:** Consistent ASAM ODX version information guarantees that the diagnostic definitions used to configure tests and send commands (**ISO 14229:2020** UDS) align perfectly with the expected format and behavior of the target system, enabling reliable and accurate diagnostic communication and testing.
