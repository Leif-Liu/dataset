The provided content outlines multiple test cases focused on validating Autonomous Driving (AD) and Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) functionalities, alerts, and user interface (UI) behaviors. Below is a structured summary:

---

### **Alerts and Messages Verification**
1. **Lane Change Alerts**:  
   - Verify activation/deactivation of alerts like "Autonomous Driving Lane Change Complete to Right," "Lane Change Timed Out Left," and "Lane Change Looking for Left/Right Opening" under conditions such as power mode (PM) changes (e.g., PM = RUN/PROPULSION/OFF) and signal overrides (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request Authenticated Signal = No Indication).  
   - Alerts must display correct text variations for different vehicle models/builds (e.g., "Keep Eyes on Road" vs. "Lane Centering Assistance Disengaging").  

2. **ADAS Capability Indications**:  
   - Validate "Autonomous Driving Unavailable" messages with reasons like "Trailer Brakes Insufficient," "Sensor Blocked," or "Camera Unavailable," ensuring they align with signal inputs (e.g., Advanced Driver Assist Systems Limited Capability State Reason Indication Request Signal).  
   - Confirm alerts deactivate when CAL (Control Authority Level) is disabled or when transitioning between power modes (e.g., PM = OFF/RUN).  

3. **Driver Attention Alerts**:  
   - Test "Keep Eyes on Road" and "Take Control" alerts triggered by signals like Hands On Lane Centering Assist Warning Indication Request Signal, ensuring they play chimes (e.g., 5 repetitions, 400ms separation) from specified speakers (e.g., DRIVER_FRONT).

### **Audio and Volume Override Tests**
1. **Chime and Audio Behavior**:  
   - Validate lane detection chimes during music playback, ensuring audio attenuation (mute) occurs when signals like Lane Detection Warning and Control Audio Attenuation Requested Signal = Disable/Enable.  
   - Test chime volume override for MUSIC, VOICE_CALL, and PROMPT volume groups with internal/external amplifiers, confirming no attenuation in accessory mode.  

2. **Speaker and Chime Configuration**:  
   - Verify chime location (e.g., Front/Left/Right), repetition count (e.g., 5 chimes), and separation (e.g., 400ms) under CAL conditions (e.g., Lane Detection Warning Hands Off 3 Chime Location CAL = Driver Front).  

---

### **UI and Settings Navigation**
1. **Preference Changes**:  
   - Confirm settings like "Open Lane Acceleration," "Lane Change Frequency," and "Lane Change Style" update correctly in the UI when using Mock FSA (mock front-end system application) and respond to confirmation signals (e.g., Preference Change Response = 1).  
   - Ensure sub-features (e.g., Sporty, Normal, Relaxed) are displayed/selected as per configuration.  

2. **Feature Availability**:  
   - Validate that "Lane Merge" (renamed to "Lane Change Style") is hidden in Automated Driving Style Custom lists, while other sub-features (e.g., Speed Through Turns) remain visible.  
   - Check UI alignment, font styles, and layout match design specifications (e.g., "Automated Driving Style - Lane Change Style" screen).  

---

### **Power Mode and Signal Dependencies**
1. **Power Mode (PM) Transitions**:  
   - Test alerts during PM changes (e.g., RUN → PROPULSION → OFF), ensuring activation/deactivation timing (e.g., 3-second timeout).  
   - Confirm Lane Centering Assistance is locked out/unavailable in specific PMs (e.g., PM = PROPULSION).  

2. **Signal Dependencies**:  
   - Verify alerts depend on signals like Advanced Driver Assist Systems Trim Level Indication Signal (e.g., Autonomous Driving/None) and Lane Centering Control Indication Request Signal (e.g., Timed Out Left).  
   - Ensure CAN messages (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request Authenticated Signal) trigger correct cluster displays.  

---

### **Special Cases and Confirmations**
1. **Mock FSA Integration**:  
   - Use Mock FSA to simulate preference changes (e.g., Sporty → Normal in Lane Change Style) and validate responses in Preference Change Request/Response flows.  
   - Confirm system handles failure responses (e.g., Preference response = Failure) gracefully.  

2. **Carpool Lane and HUD Navigation**:  
   - Verify text accuracy in "Settings → Usage of Carpool Lanes" and HUD navigation pin display alignment with map maneuvers.  

3. **Emergency and Fault Signals**:  
   - Test alerts during fault conditions (e.g., Full Authority External Vehicle Controller Low Priority Fault) and ensure chimes trigger correctly (e.g., Chime Producer Request Signal = 565/570/575).  

---

### **Key Parameters and Values**
- **Delays**: 2-second delays for message display transitions.  
- **Chime Repetition**: 5 chimes for Hands Off alerts (e.g., Lane Detection Warning Hands Off 3 Chime Repetition Count CAL = 5).  
- **Speaker Locations**: DRIVER_FRONT, Front/Left/Right for chime directionality.  
- **Power Modes**: RUN, PROPULSION, OFF, ACC (Accessory).  
- **Signals**:  
  - Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request Authenticated Signal (values: No Indication, Changing Right, Opening Left, etc.).  
  - Preference Change Response: Confirmation values (1 = confirmed, 0 = no action).  

---

### **Failure and Edge Cases**
- Ensure alerts do not display when CAL features are disabled (e.g., Lane Change Alert System Off Indication = False).  
- Validate UI handles missing features (e.g., "Lane Assistance" category card disappears when Lane Change Alert is off).  
- Test behavior with external/internal amplifiers and Bluetooth call scenarios (e.g., audio mute during chimes in Propulsion mode).
