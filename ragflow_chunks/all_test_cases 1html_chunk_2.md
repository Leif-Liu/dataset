### **Key Observations**  
- **Signal Dependencies**: Multiple test cases validate interactions between Lane Detection states (STANDBY, READY TO ASSIST, ALERT AND CONTROL), virtual control availability (Available/Not Available), and user permissions (Allowed/Not Allowed).  
- **UI Behavior**: Focus on checkbox states, snackbar messages (with timeouts), dialog visibility, and secondary text in Drive & Park/Lane Assistance screens.  
- **NoIVI Scenarios**: Test UI responses when the infotainment system is inactive, ensuring alerts/snackbars function without IVI input.  
- **Alerts and Diagnostics**: Verify cluster alerts (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Unavailable") and diagnostics masks for system components.  

All test cases emphasize synchronization between signal inputs and UI outputs, ensuring safety and usability in lane assistance features.
