The provided content outlines multiple technical test cases for validating functionalities and alerts related to **lane assistance systems** in vehicles, focusing on interactions between automated driving features, user controls, and system states. Key elements include:

### **Test Objectives & Scenarios**
1. **Lane Change Frequency & Alerts**:
   - Tests verify correct display of alerts (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Lane Change Cancelled Left") when power modes (e.g., RUN, PROPULSION, OFF) change or when lane change warnings are disabled via CAL (Configuration Adjustment Layer) settings.
   - Evaluates behavior under trailer-related limitations (e.g., **Lane Change Alert Limited by Trailer CAL** = Enabled/Disabled).

2. **Lane Keep Assist (LKA) & Blind Zone Steering Assist (BZSA)**:
   - Validates UI responses (e.g., On/Off toggles) and signal outputs (e.g., **Lane Keep Assist Selected Virtual Control Request Signal** = On/Off) when users interact with settings.
   - Checks system states: availability (e.g., "Lane Assistance must be On to enable options"), unavailability (e.g., "Blind Zone Steering Assist unavailable"), and failure modes (e.g., **Lane Detection Warning and Control Feature State** = FAILED).

3. **Power Mode Dependencies**:
   - Assesses alert activation/deactivation during power mode transitions (e.g., OFF to ACC, RUN to PROPULSION) and ensures compliance with system trim levels (e.g., **Advanced Driver Assist Systems Trim Level Indication Signal** = Autonomous Driving).

4. **User Interface (UI) & NoIVI States**:
   - Verifies UI navigation (e.g., returning to Home screen via Home Button) and functionality in NoIVI (no infotainment) scenarios, including snackbar/dialog displays and control availability.

5. **Signal Validations**:
   - Tests signal interactions (e.g., **Vehicle Speed Average Driven Authenticated Signal** >8 km/h) and hardware dependencies (e.g., voltage levels affecting **Lane Keeper Assist Amber Flashing** indicators).

### **Key Signals & Parameters**
- **Critical Signals**: 
  - **Lane Keep Assist Virtual Control Request Signal** (On/Off).
  - **Blind Zone Steering Assist Virtual Control Request Signal** (Allowed/Not Allowed).
  - **Lane Change Alert Customization Current Setting Value Signal** (ON/OFF).
  - **System Power Mode Authenticated Signal** (e.g., RUN, PROPULSION).
- **Thresholds & Indicators**:
  - **Jackknife Threshold Hysteresis CAL** = 5Â°, **Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication** states (e.g., Changing Left/Right).
  - Visual/Haptic Alerts: Amber/Green indicators, "Service Brakes Worn" warnings.

### **System Behavior Validation**
- **Alert Prioritization**: Ensures high-priority alerts (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Lane Change Unable Right") override lower-priority ones.
- **Edge Cases**: Tests system behavior during sleep/wakeup transitions, battery reconnection, and invalid signal states (e.g., **Vehicle Speed Authenticated Invalid Signal** = FALSE).

### **Outcome**
These tests ensure the lane assistance system adheres to functional safety standards, responds correctly to dynamic driving conditions, and maintains UI consistency across hardware/software configurations.
