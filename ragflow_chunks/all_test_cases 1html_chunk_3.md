The provided content outlines a series of test cases focused on validating autonomous driving features, particularly lane guidance, lane change alerts, system indicators, and user interface interactions. Below is a structured summary:

### **Key Test Objectives**:
1. **Alert Verification**:
   - Confirm activation/deactivation of alerts like **"Auto Lane Change Complete"**, **"Autonomous Driving Lane Change Timed Out"**, **"Lane Centering Assistance Disengaging"**, and **"Lane Departure Warning Unavailable"** under specific conditions (e.g., power modes like RUN, ACC, or PROPULSION).
   - Test scenarios include signal changes (e.g., setting **Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request Authenticated Signal** to values like "Lane Ending" or "Toll Booth Ahead") and user actions (e.g., pressing buttons).

2. **Signal and System Response Testing**:
   - Validate system behavior when setting signals such as **Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) Trim Level Indication Signal** (e.g., to "Autonomous Driving"), **Lane Centering Control Indication Request Authenticated Signal**, and **Adaptive Cruise Control Disengaging Indication On Signal**.
   - Check responses to mock signals (e.g., using Vehicle Simulator or Mock FSA) for scenarios like GPS signal loss, sensor unavailability, or lane narrowing.

3. **Display and Interface Validation**:
   - Ensure accurate rendering of lane guidance on **cluster displays**, **HUD**, and **infotainment systems**, including support for 8+ lanes, maneuver icons, and text (e.g., "Toll Booth Approaching").
   - Verify visual indicators (e.g., color changes for lane centering: green for active, red for warnings) and animations (e.g., flashing amber for lane departure).

4. **User Interaction and Settings**:
   - Test toggling of features like **Lane Keep Assist**, **Blind Zone Steering Assist**, and **Automated Driving Style** (e.g., presets like "Sporty" or "Custom") via UI controls.
   - Validate subscription and app enablement dependencies (e.g., Autonomous Driving app must be enabled in the home screen).

5. **Power Mode Transitions**:
   - Assess system behavior during power mode changes (e.g., OFF to ACC, RUN to PROPULSION), ensuring alerts deactivate/reactivate appropriately (e.g., "Lane Centering Assistance Disengaging" when switching to OFF).

6. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**:
   - Confirm no false alerts (e.g., no "Lane Centering Assist Standby" during OFFâ†’ACC transition).
   - Test system responses to unavailable features (e.g., "Carpool Lanes Unavailable" with error messages).

### **Key Components Tested**:
- **ADAS Signals**: Trim level, message display location, lane warnings, and control indicators.
- **Displays**: Cluster, HUD, and AR (Augmented Reality) navigation overlays.
- **User Controls**: Settings menus, virtual buttons, and preference selections (e.g., lane change frequency, open lane deceleration).
- **Environmental Simulations**: Sensor unavailability, GPS loss, and lane configuration limits.

### **Tools and Methods**:
- **Vehicle Spy**: Sending CAN messages for signal simulation.
- **Mock FSA**: Simulating preference settings and subscription states.
- **Test Frameworks**: Validating UI responses and signal logs.

### **Critical Outcomes**:
- Alerts and indicators must align with signal states and power modes.
- Lane guidance visuals must dynamically adapt to route complexity (e.g., 11-lane routes displayed across 8 slots).
- User settings (e.g., lane change style) should persist and reflect in system behavior.

This summary captures the breadth of testing across autonomous driving functionalities, emphasizing precision in signal handling, UI consistency, and system reliability under varied conditions.
