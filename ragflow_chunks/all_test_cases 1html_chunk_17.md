The content outlines test cases for **Autonomous Drive (AD)** and **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**, focusing on alerts, audio behavior, UI consistency, and system responses to **Power Mode (PM)** transitions and signal dependencies. Key elements include:  

1. **Alerts and Messages**  
   - **Lane Change Alerts** must activate/deactivate during PM changes (e.g., RUN → OFF) and signal overrides (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication = No Indication). Text variations (e.g., "Keep Eyes on Road" vs. "Take Control") must align with vehicle models.  
   - **ADAS Capability** messages (e.g., "Autonomous Drive Unavailable" due to "Trailer Brakes Insufficient" or "Sensor Blocked") must deactivate when CAL is disabled or PM changes.  
   - **Driver Alert Chimes** require 5 repetitions at 400ms intervals from designated speakers (e.g., DRIVER FRONT) for alerts like "Keep Eyes on Road" and "Take Control."  

2. **Audio and UI**  
   - Audio attenuation (e.g., muting MUSIC) during alerts must be validated, along with volume overrides for **VOICE_CALL** and **PROMPT** groups.  
   - UI updates (e.g., "Lane Change Frequency" preferences via Mock FSA) must reflect sub-features (Sporty, Normal) and hide elements like "Lane Merge" in custom lists. Layout adherence to design specifications is critical.  

3. **Power Mode and Signal Triggers**  
   - Alerts (e.g., "Lane Centering Assistance Hands On Active") deactivate at PM = OFF. System behavior depends on signals like **Advanced Driver Assist Trim Level** and CAN message triggers for cluster displays.  

4. **Special and Edge Cases**  
   - Test preference changes (e.g., Sporty → Normal) in Mock FSA, fault handling (e.g., Full Authority External Vehicle Controller Low Priority Fault), and carpool lane/HUD navigation pin alignment.  
   - Alerts must not display when CAL features are off (e.g., Lane Change Alert System Off Indication = False). UI elements (e.g., "Lane Assistance" card) should disappear when disabled, and audio scenarios must account for Bluetooth calls and amplifier configurations.  

**Key Parameters**:  
- **Delays**: 2-second transitions for message displays.  
- **Chimes/Alerts** : 5 repetitions, 400ms intervals for Hands Off alerts.  
- **PM States** : RUN, PROPULSION, OFF, ACC.  
- **Signals** : Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request (values: Changing Right, Opening Left), Preference Change Response (1 = confirmed).  

Tests use tools like **Vehicle Spy** for signal setup, delays, and fault simulation, with emphasis on **alert accuracy, audio prioritization, UI consistency, and system robustness** during PM transitions and edge conditions.
