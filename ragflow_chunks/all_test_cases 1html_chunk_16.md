**Summary of ADAS Test Cases for Autonomous Driving Systems**  

The test cases validate functionality, alerts, and user interface interactions for **Lane Centering Assistance (LCA)**, **Lane Keep Assist (LKA)**, and other ADAS features under varying conditions. Key aspects include:  

### **1. Alert Behavior Across Power Modes (PM)**  
- Alerts like "Lane Centering Off" or "Autonomous Driving Unavailable" activate/deactivate based on PM states (RUN, ACC, PROPULSION, OFF).  
- Specific alerts (e.g., "Lane Too Narrow," "Toll Booth Ahead") are triggered by authenticated CAN signals (e.g., `ASDRP_LnCntrWrnExtdIndReqAuth`).  
- Alerts cycle every **12 seconds** when paired with secondary warnings (e.g., "Brakes Overheated").  

### **2. Configuration & Signal Validation**  
- **CAL Parameters** (e.g., Audio Safety Volume Override Level CAL = 0) and signals (e.g., `Brake Pad Worn Indication On Signal`) are set to predefined values to enable/disable features.  
- Safety systems like **TJA** and **LDWC** are disabled in specific scenarios.  
- Test cases verify correct navigation to settings screens (e.g., Lane Assistance) via CAN signals.  

### **3. Alert Prioritization**  
- High-priority alerts (e.g., "Sensors Can't Find Lane Lines") override lower-priority ones, activating within **3 seconds**.  
- Medium/low-priority alerts (e.g., "Lane Centering Locked Out") cycle with secondary warnings like "Service Parking Brake."  

### **4. Visual Indicators & Display Rules**  
- **Telltale colors** (green = active, amber = warning, red = critical) and states (steady/flashing) are validated.  
- Display locations (cluster, HUD) and interactions with other indicators (e.g., speed, brake warnings) are tested for clarity.  

### **5. System Transitions & Edge Cases**  
- Alerts deactivate upon PM changes (e.g., RUN â†’ OFF) or timeouts (e.g., "Lane Ending" after 2 seconds).  
- Edge cases include **CAL-disabled features** (e.g., "Autonomous Driving NA Lane Too Narrow") and **trailer limitations**.  

### **6. Test Case Examples**  
- **Power Mode Tests**:  
  - **TC_Cluster_Alert_2148_Basic_RUN2**: Alert deactivates within 3 seconds when PM shifts to PROPULSION.  
  - **TC_Cluster_Alert_536_PM_PROPULSION**: Validates Lane Change Alert behavior during PM transitions.  
- **MFC Simulator Actions**:  
  - Knob nudges/rotations test UI navigation (e.g., cycling alerts every 12 seconds).  
- **Scenario-Based Alerts**:  
  - Sensor failures, toll booths, and brake overheating trigger specific alerts (e.g., "Toll Booth Ahead").  

### **Key Parameters**  
- **Power Modes Tested**: RUN, OFF, PROPULSION, ACCESSORY.  
- **Critical Signals**: `Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication`, `ADAS Trim Level`, `Brake Pad Worn Indication`.  
- **Alert Timing**: 3-second activation/deactivation thresholds, 12-second cycling intervals.  

**Objective**: Ensure ADAS alerts, visual indicators, and system responses function correctly under predefined conditions, adhering to timing, priority hierarchies, and configurations across vehicle models and software builds.
