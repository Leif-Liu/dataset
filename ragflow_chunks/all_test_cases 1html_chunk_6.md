The content details test cases for validating Autonomous Driving (AD) and Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS), focusing on alerts, audio behavior, UI consistency, and system responsiveness to **Power Mode (PM)** transitions and signal dependencies. Key aspects include:  

1. **Alerts and Messages**:  
   - **Lane Change Alerts**: Test activation/deactivation under PM changes (e.g., RUN → OFF) and signal overrides (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication = No Indication). Text variations (e.g., "Keep Eyes on Road" vs. "Lane Centering Assistance Disengaging") must match vehicle models.  
   - **ADAS Capability**: Verify "Autonomous Driving Unavailable" messages (reasons: "Trailer Brakes Insufficient," "Sensor Blocked") align with signals and deactivate when CAL is disabled or PM changes.  
   - **Driver Attention Alerts**: Confirm chimes (5 repetitions, 400ms intervals) from specified speakers (e.g., DRIVER_FRONT) for "Keep Eyes on Road" and "Take Control" alerts.  

2. **Audio and Volume Overrides**:  
   - Ensure audio attenuation (mute) during alerts (e.g., Lane Detection Warning) and validate volume overrides for MUSIC, VOICE_CALL, and PROMPT groups. Test chime configuration (location, repetition) under CAL conditions and accessory mode.  

3. **UI and Settings**:  
   - Validate UI updates for preferences (e.g., "Lane Change Frequency") via Mock FSA, ensuring sub-features (Sporty, Normal) display correctly. Confirm "Lane Merge" is hidden in custom lists and UI layout adheres to design specs.  

4. **Power Mode (PM) and Signal Dependencies**:  
   - Alerts must activate/deactivate based on PM transitions (e.g., "Lane Centering Assistance Hands On Active" deactivates at PM = OFF). Test dependencies on signals (e.g., Advanced Driver Assist Systems Trim Level) and CAN message triggers for cluster displays.  

5. **Special Cases**:  
   - Mock FSA simulations for preference changes (e.g., Sporty → Normal) and handling failure responses. Verify carpool lane settings, HUD navigation pin alignment, and alerts during faults (e.g., Full Authority External Vehicle Controller Low Priority Fault).  

6. **Key Parameters**:  
   - **Delays**: 2-second transitions for message displays.  
   - **Chimes**: 5 repetitions for Hands Off alerts, 400ms separation.  
   - **PMs**: RUN, PROPULSION, OFF, ACC.  
   - **Signals**: Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request (values: Changing Right, Opening Left), Preference Change Response (1 = confirmed).  

7. **Edge Cases**:  
   - Ensure alerts do not display when CAL features are off (e.g., Lane Change Alert System Off Indication = False). Validate UI behavior when features are disabled (e.g., "Lane Assistance" card disappears) and test audio scenarios (Bluetooth calls, internal/external amplifiers).  

Tests follow structured steps: signal setup via tools like Vehicle Spy, delays, and verification of alert timing, UI alignment, and system responses to faults or invalid subscriptions. Focus areas: accuracy of alerts, audio prioritization, UI consistency, and robustness under PM transitions and edge conditions.
