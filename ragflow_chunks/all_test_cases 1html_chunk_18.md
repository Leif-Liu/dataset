**Summary of Lane Assistance System Test Cases**  

The content details technical test cases for validating vehicle lane assistance systems (LKA, BZSA, HoLCA, LDW), focusing on functional safety, UI consistency, and signal interactions. Key aspects include:  

### **Test Objectives**  
1. **Lane Change Alerts**:  
   - Verify alerts (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Lane Change Cancelled Left") trigger correctly during power mode transitions (RUN, PROPULSION, ACC) and trailer-related limitations (e.g., **Lane Change Alert Limited by Trailer CAL** = Enabled/Disabled).  

2. **LKA/BZSA Functionality**:  
   - Validate UI toggles and signal outputs (e.g., **Lane Keep Assist Selected Virtual Control Request Signal** = On/Off) under system states like availability, unavailability, and failure (e.g., **Lane Detection Warning and Control Feature State** = FAILED).  

3. **Power Mode Dependencies**:  
   - Ensure alerts deactivate/reactivate during power mode shifts (e.g., OFF to ACC, RUN to PROPULSION) and align with trim levels (e.g., **Advanced Driver Assist Systems Trim Level** = Autonomous Driving).  

4. **UI/NoIVI Testing**:  
   - Confirm UI navigation (e.g., Home Button functionality), snackbar/dialog displays, and control availability in infotainment-off (NoIVI) scenarios.  

5. **Signal & Threshold Validation**:  
   - Test critical signals (e.g., **Vehicle Speed Average Driven Authenticated Signal** >8 km/h) and thresholds (e.g., **Jackknife Threshold Hysteresis CAL** = 5Â°).

### **Key Components**  
- **Signals**:  
  - **Lane Keep Assist/BZSA Virtual Control Request Signals** (On/Off/Allowed/Not Allowed).  
  - **System Power Mode Authenticated Signal** (e.g., RUN, PROPULSION).  
  - **Lane Detection States** (STANDBY, READY TO ASSIST, ALERT AND CONTROL).  

- **Alerts & Indicators**:  
  - Visual (amber/green icons), haptic feedback, and priority-based alerts (e.g., high-priority "Autonomous Driving Lane Change Unable Right" overriding lower ones).  

- **Edge Cases**:  
  - System behavior during sleep/wakeup cycles, battery reconnection, and invalid signal states (e.g., **Vehicle Speed Authenticated Invalid Signal** = FALSE).

### **Test Case Highlights**  
- **TC 652**: Confirms "Lane Change Alert Limited by Trailer" alert visibility when CAL = Enabled and power mode = RUN.  
- **TC 660**: Validates BZSA checkbox state in IVI screens under specific power and feature states.  
- **TC 835/TC 908**: Test snackbars in NoIVI mode (e.g., "Blind Zone Steering Assist unavailable" dismisses in 3 seconds).  
- **TC 1117**: Ensures alerts deactivate correctly in ACC power mode when Lane Centering Warning = No Indication.  
- **TC 1407/TC 1607**: Verify UI prompts (e.g., "Lane Assistance must be On") during invalid configurations in NoIVI and individual pages.  

---

### **Outcomes**  
- System adheres to safety standards, ensuring alerts respond dynamically to driving conditions (speed, power modes, trailer presence).  
- UI consistency across hardware/software configurations, including NoIVI states and signal-dependent control availability.  
- Prioritization of critical alerts and proper handling of edge cases (e.g., battery reconnection, invalid signals).  

This structured approach ensures robust validation of lane assistance features, aligning signal logic with user-facing responses for safety and usability.
