**Summary of ADAS Test Cases for Autonomous Driving Systems**  

The test cases validate functionality, alerts, and interface interactions for **Autonomous Drive (AD)** and **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**, focusing on alerts, audio behavior, UI consistency, and system responses to **Power Mode (PM)** transitions and signal dependencies. Key elements include:  

### **1. Alert Behavior & Power Modes**  
- Alerts (e.g., "Lane Change Alert," "Autonomous Drive Unavailable") activate/deactivate based on PM states (**RUN, PROPULSION, OFF, ACC**) and signals (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication).  
- Alerts like "Lane Centering Off" repeat every **12 seconds** when paired with secondary warnings. High-priority alerts (e.g., "Sensors Can't Find Lane Lines") override lower-priority ones within **3 seconds**.  
- Alerts deactivate during PM transitions (e.g., RUN → OFF) or timeouts (e.g., "Lane Ending" after **2 seconds**).  

### **2. Audio & UI Requirements**  
- **Driver Alert Chimes**: 5 repetitions at **400ms intervals** from designated speakers (e.g., DRIVER FRONT) for alerts like "Keep Eyes on Road." Audio attenuation (e.g., muting MUSIC) and volume overrides for **VOICE_CALL/PROMPT** groups are validated.  
- UI updates (e.g., "Lane Change Frequency" preferences) must reflect sub-features (Sporty, Normal) and hide elements like "Lane Merge" when disabled. Layout adherence to design specs is critical.  

### **3. Signal Dependencies & Configuration**  
- System behavior depends on signals like **Advanced Driver Assist Trim Level** and **CAL Parameters** (e.g., Audio Safety Volume Override Level = 0). Features disable under faults (e.g., "Trailer Brakes Insufficient") or signal overrides (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication = No Indication).  

### **4. Edge Cases & Special Scenarios**  
- Test preference changes (e.g., Sporty → Normal), fault handling (e.g., Full Authority External Vehicle Controller Fault), and scenarios like trailer limitations, sensor failures, or brake overheating.  
- Alerts must not display when CAL features are off (e.g., Lane Change Alert System Off Indication = False).  

### **5. Key Parameters**  
- **PM States Tested**: RUN, OFF, PROPULSION, ACCESSORY.  
- **Critical Signals**: `Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication`, `ADAS Trim Level`, `Brake Pad Worn Indication`.  
- **Timing**: 2-second transitions for UI updates, 3-second alert activation thresholds, 12-second cycling intervals for paired alerts.  

### **Testing Tools & Objectives**  
- Tools like **Vehicle Spy** simulate signals, delays, and faults.  
- Objective: Ensure ADAS alerts, visual indicators (color-coded: green/amber/red), and system responses function correctly across PM states, priority hierarchies, and edge conditions, adhering to timing and configuration requirements.  

This ensures robustness in alert accuracy, audio prioritization, UI consistency, and system behavior during transitions and faults.
