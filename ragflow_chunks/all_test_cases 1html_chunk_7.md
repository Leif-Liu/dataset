**Summary of ADAS and Autonomous Driving System Testing**  

The summaries outline comprehensive test cases for **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** and autonomous driving systems, focusing on alerts, audio/visual behavior, UI consistency, and system responses under varying conditions. Key aspects include:  

### **Core Test Focus Areas**  
1. **Alert Behavior & Power Modes (PM):**  
   - Alerts (e.g., "Lane Change Alert," "Autonomous Drive Unavailable") activate/deactivate based on PM states (**RUN, PROPULSION, OFF, ACC**) and signals (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication).  
   - High-priority alerts override lower ones within **3 seconds**; repetitive alerts (e.g., "Lane Centering Off") recur every **12 seconds** during paired warnings.  
   - Alerts deactivate during PM transitions (e.g., RUN → OFF) or after timeouts (e.g., "Lane Ending" after **2 seconds**).  

2. **Audio & UI Requirements:**  
   - **Driver Alert Chimes**: 5 repetitions at **400ms intervals** from specific speakers (e.g., DRIVER FRONT), with audio attenuation (e.g., muting MUSIC) and volume overrides for **VOICE_CALL/PROMPT** groups.  
   - UI updates (e.g., "Lane Change Frequency" preferences) must reflect configurations (Sporty, Normal), hide disabled elements (e.g., "Lane Merge"), and adhere to design specs.  

3. **Signal Dependencies & Fault Handling:**  
   - System behavior depends on signals like **Advanced Driver Assist Trim Level** and **CAL Parameters** (e.g., Audio Safety Volume Override Level = 0). Features disable under faults (e.g., "Trailer Brakes Insufficient") or signal overrides (e.g., Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication = No Indication).  
   - Alerts must not display when CAL features are off (e.g., Lane Change Alert System Off Indication = False).  

4. **Edge Cases & Scenarios:**  
   - Test preference changes (e.g., Sporty → Normal), fault handling (e.g., Full Authority External Vehicle Controller Fault), and scenarios like trailer limitations, sensor failures, or brake overheating.  

### **Key Parameters & Tools**  
- **PM States Tested**: RUN, OFF, PROPULSION, ACCESSORY.  
- **Critical Signals**: `Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication`, `ADAS Trim Level`, `Brake Pad Worn Indication`.  
- **Timing**:  
  - 2-second transitions for UI updates.  
  - 3-second alert activation thresholds.  
  - 12-second cycling intervals for paired alerts.  
- **Tools**: **Vehicle Spy** simulates signals, delays, and faults.  

### **Lane Assistance Testing**  
- **Objectives**: Validate lane change alerts (e.g., cancellation due to trailers), UI toggle behavior (e.g., LKA/BZSA controls), and signal interactions (e.g., **Vehicle Speed Average Driven Authenticated Signal** >8 km/h).  
- **Test Cases**:  
  - TC 652: Alert visibility with trailer CAL enabled in PM RUN.  
  - TC 660: BZSA checkbox state in IVI screens.  
  - TC 835/908: Snackbar functionality in NoIVI mode (3-second dismissal).  
- **Outcomes**: Safety compliance, dynamic alert adjustments (speed, trailer presence), and UI consistency.  

### **Autonomous Driving Testing**  
- **Focus**: Alert triggers via CAN signals (e.g., *"ADAS Trim Level"* = Autonomous Driving), UI/UX consistency across displays (Cluster, HUD), and edge-case reliability (GPS loss, poor weather).  
- **Technical Aspects**: ADAS ECU communication, signal authentication (e.g., *"Lane Centering Control Indication Request"*), and user preference simulation (e.g., "Lane Change Frequency" via Mock FSA).  
- **Outcomes**: Alerts align with signal states (e.g., *"Lane Departure Warning Unavailable"* when sensors are offline), adaptive UI (e.g., 8+ lanes rendered dynamically), and robustness under extreme scenarios.  

### **Overall Objectives**  
Ensure safety compliance, precise signal handling, and consistent UI/UX across power modes, trim levels, and environmental conditions. Critical thresholds (e.g., **Jackknife Threshold** = 5°) and tools like Vehicle Spy are vital for validation.
