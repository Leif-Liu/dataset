The provided paragraphs outline multiple test cases (TC) for verifying functionalities and alerts related to **Lane Centering Assistance (LCA)**, **Lane Keep Assist (LKA)**, and other Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) under varying conditions. Key details include:

1. **Alert Verification Across Power Modes (PM):**  
   - Tests confirm alerts like "Take control. Lane centering off" or "Lane Centering Assistance Disengaging" activate/deactivate correctly in PM states (RUN, ACC, PROPULSION, OFF).  
   - Specific alerts (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Unavailable: Can't See Lane Lines," "Lane Too Narrow," "Exit Lane") are validated when triggered by signals such as **Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request Authenticated Signal** or **Autonomous Driving Lane Ending CAL**.  
   - Alerts often cycle every 12 seconds when paired with secondary warnings (e.g., "Service Brakes Worn," "Brakes Overheated").

2. **Configuration and Signal Settings:**  
   - **CAL (Configuration Acceptance Level)** parameters (e.g., Audio Safety Volume Override Level CAL = 0, Trailer Warning Enable CAL = True) are set to predefined values to enable/disable features.  
   - Safety features like **TJA (Traffic Jam Assist)**, **PCM (Pre-Collision Mitigation)**, and **LDWC (Lane Departure Warning Control)** are disabled in certain scenarios.  
   - Signals such as **Hands On Lane Centering Assist Warning Indication Request Signal** or **Brake Pad Worn Indication On Signal** are manipulated to simulate system states.

3. **Priority Alert Interactions:**  
   - High-priority alerts (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Unavailable: Sensors Can't Find Lane Lines") override lower-priority ones, with specific timing (e.g., 3 seconds) for activation/deactivation.  
   - Medium/low-priority alerts (e.g., "Lane Centering Assistance Locked Out") cycle with secondary alerts like "Service Parking Brake" or "Adaptive Cruise Disengaging."

4. **Visual Indicators and Display Rules:**  
   - **Telltale colors** (green, amber, red) and states (steady, flashing) are tested for accuracy (e.g., green for active LCA, amber for warnings, red for critical alerts).  
   - Display locations (cluster screen, HUD) and interactions with other indicators (e.g., speed value, brake warnings) are validated to ensure no overlap or incorrect visual feedback.

5. **System Behavior Transitions:**  
   - Alerts deactivate upon PM changes (e.g., from RUN to OFF) or after timeouts (e.g., 2 seconds for "Lane Ending").  
   - Features like **Lane Change Alert (LCA)** and **Shuttle Mode** are checked for availability and correct UI navigation.

6. **Edge Cases and Overrides:**  
   - Scenarios like **CAL disabled** (e.g., "Autonomous Driving NA Lane Too Narrow") or **trailer limitations** trigger specific alerts.  
   - Driver inputs (e.g., brake overheating, lack of steering interaction) influence alert activation sequences.

**Summary:** These tests ensure ADAS alerts and visual indicators function correctly under predefined conditions, adhering to timing, priority hierarchies, and system configurations, while validating compatibility across vehicle models and software builds.
