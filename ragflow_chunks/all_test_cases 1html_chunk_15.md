**Summary of Autonomous Driving System Test Cases:**

The content details comprehensive test cases for validating autonomous driving systems, focusing on **functional reliability, alert accuracy, UI consistency, and system interactions** under diverse scenarios. Key elements include:

### **Core Test Areas**  
1. **Alert Verification**:  
   - Validate alerts (e.g., *"Autonomous Driving Unavailable – Trailer Over Weight Limit," "Lane Centering Assistance Can’t See Face"*) triggered by specific **CAN signals** (e.g., ADAS Trim Level set to "Autonomous Driving") and system states (power modes, sensor inputs).  
   - Confirm activation/deactivation based on conditions like power mode transitions (e.g., OFF→RUN) or feature toggling (e.g., disabling Adaptive Cruise Control).  

2. **System Interactions**:  
   - **CAN Signal Testing**: Use tools like **Vehicle Spy** to send raw CAN messages (e.g., *"Lane Centering Warning Extended Indication Request"* = "Trailer Narrow Lane") and verify responses.  
   - **Mock FSA Integration**: Simulate preference changes (e.g., enabling/disabling "Lane Change Frequency") to test UI updates without unintended side effects.  

3. **UI/UX Validation**:  
   - Ensure alerts display correctly on **Cluster Display, Center Stack, or HUD**, with dynamic updates for lane guidance (e.g., 8+ lanes rendered across 11 slots) and visual cues (e.g., green/red indicators for lane centering status).  
   - Test navigability of settings menus (e.g., *"Automated Driving Style"*) and control responsiveness (e.g., radio buttons, back navigation).  

4. **Condition-Specific Testing**:  
   - Validate behavior under edge cases (e.g., *"No Road Information," "Poor Weather Conditions"*) and power mode shifts (e.g., deactivating *"Lane Centering Assistance"* in OFF mode).  
   - Confirm no false alerts (e.g., no *"Lane Centering Assist Standby"* during OFF→ACC transitions).  

5. **Technical Components**:  
   - **ADAS ECU Communication**: Verify IVI-ADAS ECU interactions via CAN networks, including authenticated signals (e.g., *"Serial Data 34 Protected"*).  
   - **Signal Authentication**: Ensure secure responses to signals like *"Lane Centering Control Indication Request."*  

### **Tools & Methods**  
- **Vehicle Spy**: Simulate CAN signals for testing (e.g., *"Adaptive Cruise Control Disengaging Indication"*).  
- **Mock FSA**: Replicate user preferences and subscription states (e.g., enabling the Autonomous Driving app).  
- **Test Frameworks**: Log signal responses and validate UI behavior.  

### **Critical Outcomes**  
- Alerts and indicators must align with signal states (e.g., *"Lane Departure Warning Unavailable"* when sensors are offline).  
- UI elements (e.g., lane guidance animations, error messages) must dynamically adapt to driving conditions and user settings.  
- System reliability under edge cases (e.g., GPS loss, sensor unavailability) and adherence to design specifications (e.g., lane change frequency persistence).  

This testing ensures **precision in signal handling, UI consistency, and robustness** across scenarios, from routine driving to rare edge cases.
