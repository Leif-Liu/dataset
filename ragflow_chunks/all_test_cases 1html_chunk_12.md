**Summary of Vehicle Lane Assistance and Autonomous Driving System Testing**  

**Lane Assistance Testing**  
- **Objectives**: Validate lane change alerts (e.g., cancellation due to trailer presence), UI toggle behavior (e.g., LKA/BZSA controls), signal interactions (e.g., **Vehicle Speed Average Driven Authenticated Signal** >8 km/h), and alert responses during power mode transitions (RUN, PROPULSION, ACC).  
- **Components**: Signals like **Lane Keep Assist Virtual Control Request**, power modes, lane detection states (STANDBY, READY TO ASSIST), and alerts (visual, haptic, priority-based).  
- **Test Cases**:  
  - TC 652: Alert visibility when trailer CAL is enabled and power mode = RUN.  
  - TC 660: BZSA checkbox state in IVI screens under specific conditions.  
  - TC 835/908: Snackbar functionality in NoIVI mode (e.g., 3-second dismissal).  
  - TC 1117: Alert deactivation in ACC mode when Lane Centering Warning = No Indication.  
- **Outcomes**: Compliance with safety standards, dynamic alert adjustments (speed, trailer presence), and consistent UI across configurations.  

**Autonomous Driving Testing**  
- **Focus**: Alert triggers via CAN signals (e.g., *"ADAS Trim Level"* = Autonomous Driving), system interactions (tested with **Vehicle Spy**), UI/UX consistency across displays (Cluster, Center Stack, HUD), and edge-case reliability (GPS loss, poor weather).  
- **Technical Aspects**: ADAS ECU communication, signal authentication (e.g., *"Lane Centering Control Indication Request"*), and user preference simulation (e.g., "Lane Change Frequency" via Mock FSA).  
- **Outcomes**: Alerts align with signal states (e.g., *"Lane Departure Warning Unavailable"* when sensors are offline), adaptive UI (e.g., 8+ lanes rendered dynamically), and robustness under extreme scenarios.  

**Overall**: Testing ensures safety compliance, precise signal handling, and consistent UI/UX across power modes, trim levels, and environmental conditions. Key thresholds (e.g., **Jackknife Threshold** = 5Â°) and tools (Vehicle Spy) are critical to validation.
