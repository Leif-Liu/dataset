The provided content outlines multiple test cases (TCs) focused on validating the behavior of Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD) features under varying **Power Modes (PM)** (e.g., RUN, ACC, PROPULSION, OFF) and signal configurations. Key elements include:

1. **Signal Configurations**:  
   - Setting signals like **Advanced Driver Assist Systems Trim Level Indication Signal** to "Autonomous Driving" or "None" and **Message Display Location** to "Cluster Display," "Center Stack Display," or "Both."  
   - Testing alerts (e.g., "Auto Lane Change Complete," "Lane Centering Unavailable," "Adaptive Cruise Disengaging") for activation/deactivation based on PM changes (e.g., RUN to PROPULSION/OFF) and authenticated CAN messages (sent via Vehicle Spy).  

2. **Alert Verification**:  
   - Alerts are tested for proper display timing, location, and deactivation (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Lane Change Complete to Right" must activate/deactivate under specific PM transitions).  
   - Scenarios include lane-ending conditions, trailer-related limitations, invalid subscriptions, and user interactions (e.g., pressing the SWC button).  

3. **UI and System Checks**:  
   - Validating UI toggles (e.g., "Auto Lane Change for Time" On/Off selection), pop-ups, and navigation menus in the Autonomous Driving app.  
   - Confirming system responses to Mock FSA configurations, such as enabling/disabling features (e.g., "Lane Keep Assist," "Blind Zone Steering Assist") and verifying visual/audio alerts.  

4. **Audio and Chime Testing**:  
   - Assessing audio attenuation during alerts (e.g., music muting during chime signals) and verifying chime behavior across PM states.  

5. **Power Mode Transitions**:  
   - Alerts like "Lane Centering Assistance Hands On Active" must deactivate when switching PM from RUN to OFF, while others (e.g., "Autonomous Driving Changing Lanes to Follow Route") activate/reactivate upon PM changes.  

6. **Special Conditions**:  
   - Testing edge cases, such as system limitations (e.g., "Lane Too Narrow for Trailer"), invalid subscriptions, and driver mode conflicts (e.g., "Steering Assist Unavailable in Selected Driver Mode").  

Each test case follows structured steps involving signal setup, delays (often 2 seconds), and verification of alert states, UI elements, and system responses. The focus is on ensuring ADAS/AD alerts function correctly across PM transitions, display locations, and external conditions (e.g., trailer braking, sensor limitations).
