The diagnostic tools rely on the structure and definitions within the specific version of the ODX file to correctly interpret the data received from the vehicle's Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in response to requests for specific Data Identifiers (DIDs).\n\n2.  **To Provide Accurate Version Information:** The content explicitly states that maintaining consistent version information is necessary to \"provide accurate version information\" when queried via diagnostic services. This ensures that the diagnostic tool and the technician have reliable information about the configuration database version in use.\n\n3.  **To Support Reliable Diagnostic Communication:** The ASAM ODX file acts as the `diagnostic configuration database`. Consistency between the version used by the diagnostic tool and the version understood by the vehicle's diagnostic system (e.g., the IVI system implementing UDS according to ISO 14229:2020) is fundamental for reliable communication using UDS diagnostic messages over network protocols like SOME/IP. Mismatched versions could lead to misinterpretation of DIDs, sessions, or other diagnostic parameters.\n\n**Direct Evidence from the Content:**\n*   The keywords list includes: \"consistent version information\" and \"Read Data by Identifier\".\n*   The content discusses the use of the ODX file within a UDS diagnostic context (IVI system, ISO 14229:2020) and the execution of diagnostic services like `Read Data by Identifier` which depend on the database definitions.\n*   The ODX file is explicitly referred to as the \"diagnostic configuration database\".\n*   The context involves manual test execution using predefined diagnostic session commands and reading DIDs, which fundamentally relies on the tool and vehicle agreeing on the database definitions provided by the ODX file version."

Maintaining a consistent version ensures that the definitions for **Data Identifiers (DIDs)** remain uniform.\n2.  **To Avoid Undefined DIDs and Test Failures:** Using an ODX file with a *different version* than expected during **manual test execution** can lead to inconsistencies. Specifically:\n    *   The test procedure might request a DID defined in *one version* of the ODX file.\n    *   If the vehicle's ECU or the **RBS Sparks Simulation environment** uses a *different ODX version* where that DID is undefined or defined differently, the ECU may return an error (e.g., \"sub-function not supported\").\n    *   This discrepancy causes the test (e.g., a **Read Data by Identifier** request within the **OBDII default diagnostic session** or **extended diagnostic session**) to fail, even if the underlying ECU functionality is correct.\n3.  **To Guarantee Test Validity:** Consistent ODX versions are critical for validating the correct implementation and response of **UDS diagnostic messages** (as per **ISO 14229:2020**) over **SOME/IP network communication protocols** in the test environment. Inconsistent versions invalidate the test results by introducing definition mismatches.\n\n**In essence:** Maintaining consistent ASAM ODX file version information is necessary to ensure that the diagnostic tests (using **predefined diagnostic session commands** and **Read Data by Identifier** for specific DIDs) interact with the vehicle or simulation based on the *same definitions* of parameters and services, preventing false negatives caused by version mismatches in the **diagnostic configuration database**."

This includes fundamental operations like initiating an **OBDII default diagnostic session**, transitioning to an **extended diagnostic session**, and successfully executing **Read Data by Identifier** requests for specific **data identifiers (DIDs)**. Version consistency ensures the diagnostic client and server share the same understanding of session types, DIDs, and their formats.\n\n2.  **To preserve diagnostic configuration integrity:** Maintaining version consistency between the **diagnostic configuration database** (the ASAM ODX file) and the system under test (e.g., within the **RBS Sparks Simulation environment**) is essential. This consistency ensures that **UDS diagnostic messages** sent over **SOME/IP network communication protocols** adhere to the expected structure and semantics defined in the specific version of the ODX file, preventing misinterpretation or failure during **manual test execution** using **predefined diagnostic session commands**.\n\n**In essence:** Consistent ASAM ODX version information guarantees that the diagnostic definitions used to configure tests and send commands (**ISO 14229:2020** UDS) align perfectly with the expected format and behavior of the target system, enabling reliable and accurate diagnostic communication and testing."
